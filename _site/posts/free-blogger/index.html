		<p>It was back in 2012, when I made my first blog, That was a blog hosted in <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress(dot)com</a>, then about a year later, in 2013, I deleted that blog and made another one in <a href="http://blogspot.com">blogspot</a>, then nex year I went to live in a hostel where using internet was not allowed. Then when I got back, I again deleted my blog. Then when I completed my school level, I had no work to do, until my highschool starts, which had a gap of three months. Then I started to discover internet, then I found about a website <a href="dot.tk">dot(dot)tk</a> which gave free dot tk domains. Then in 2014 I made my blog <a href="/">bibekadhikari.tk</a>. Which I used to maintain by blogger. Between these periods, I had already learnt <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTML</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">CSS</code>, then being unable to use what I had learnt on blogger, I deleted that blog again. Then I searched for free web hosting sites. I hosted throuh many sites, the first was <a href="http://1freehosting.com">1freehosting</a>, then I went through <a href="http://000webhost.com">000webhost</a>, then others, there I made a blog using only html and css, then as soon as my blog started to get some visitiors, even 100 a day, that made my blog crash atleast trice for every 10 times. Then I installed <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress</a> in my website, that made the website lag even more, it was next to impossible to read two pages consecutively without being told server has crashed once. Then I had a visti of one hosting to other, exploring one after another. Every free hosting provider had atleast one problem. Either it be speed, bandwidth, space, or anything. Something always made a problem. Then back in 2016 being frustrated, I again deleted my blog. I was in a problem regarding my blog. I have deleted my blog more than 10 times. Deleted almost 100 posts and for nothing. Then I heard about jekyll, I really wanted to write blog again, make designs again, I explored <a href="http://github.com">github</a>, read posts, written posts, made designs and reopened my blog. And what have i spend 0$. For my blog, Iâ€™ve never spent even a cent. If I do not count the internet pack, that I was using for writing my blog, I am not counting it because even if I had a paid hosting, I had to spent additional money for writing posts using my internet packs. If you also want to make a blog, just for writing, spent no money, as you can do it all for free. But if you have a mentality of earning money by writing blog. Then I recommend you to get a commercial domain, spend a few bucks to get your domain and hosting, perhaps you get free domain with your paid hosting. But if you possibly want a free domain, then you can go to <a href="http://freenom.com">freenom</a>
<img src="/img/freenom1.png" alt="Freenom1" />
<img src="/img/freenom2.png" alt="Freenom2" />
<img src="/img/freenom3.png" alt="Freenom3" />
<img src="/img/freenom4.png" alt="Freenom4" />
Now you can register like you do for any social network and you new free domain is up and running.</p>
