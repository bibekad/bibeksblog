		<p>I have finally transfered my <a href="/">blog</a> to Jekyll, for someone like me, who likes things free rather than paid, Using Jekyll to make my blog has been blessing. As you can see I am using a free web domain <a href="http://dot.tk">dot tk</a> made using website <a href="http://freenom.com">freenom</a>, making a stable website has always been a trouble. There are many free hosting sites like <a href="http://000webhost.com">000webhost</a> or <a href="http://1freehosting.com">1freehosting</a> but they are not upto mark. For free there is not much to complain, but my website had its server crashed like <strong>4 times in every 10 times</strong>. People also asked me, why did not I use websites like <a href="http://blogspot.com">blogspot</a> or <a href="http://wix.com">wix</a> to run my blog. Yes, while using blogspot or wix or yola or such other websites the blog never crashed. And I used it much time ago, but there was some other problem, like, while using blogspt to make my blog, I found it very hard to edit the layouts and ther was not much freedom to choose how my blog looks like. The only template that I ever liked in blogspot was dynamic template, but choosing dynamic template made the website slower. Now coming to drag and drop design websites like wix or yola, there was always a limit till which I could use the facilities provided by them, as long as I wanted to do something, it was out of services provided to free account, and yes the website did not crash, but was almost always slow. Then I tried the <strong>Go Site</strong> provided by freenom, that was a lot hard than wix or yola, or weebly. Yes I liked weebly, but it was almost not free, to give a website to my domain was not free, but I could use free subdomain provided by weebly which was actually good. Now lets talk about Go site, free - yes, fast - yes, good user interference - no. Now, my website is as stable as any other paid websites. This is due to hosting my website using <a href="http://github.com">github</a>. Language used is jekyll. What I got using jekyll was freedom, the freedom to make my own layout, the freedom to edit anything I want using pre-loaded templates. Even writing content became fun. It was like I am the godfather of my website. But there are limitations of using Jekyll too. For me, as I got my domain from <strong>Freenom</strong>, there was no C-panel. Using <strong>000webhost</strong> and <strong>1freehosting</strong>, I used to get free Cpanel, but since now I am not using any hosting site, I do not have any free C-panel. Setting up jekyll is not that hard, if you are using linux, or mac, but for windows, it is. You can also visit <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> to see how is github setup in windows.Then you can visit a website <a href="https://milanaryal.com/jekyll-on-windows/">Milanaryal.com</a> I found it usefull for windows users, to set up jekyll. But in linux it is very easy, you just have to open terminal, run a couple of commands and you are done, simple is that.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">jekyll</span> <span class="n">bundler</span> <span class="c1">#--&gt; To install jekyll</span>
<span class="c1">#--&gt; Now open directory where you want to save your blog</span>
<span class="n">jekyll</span> <span class="kp">new</span> <span class="n">blog</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After running above two codes, you will have a folder named blog on you terminal opened directory. Then you can open the folder.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">jekyll</span> <span class="n">serve</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">incremental</span> 
<span class="c1">#--&gt;//OR</span>
<span class="n">jekyll</span> <span class="n">serve</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now you can make a blog out of it, and host it in github.</p>
