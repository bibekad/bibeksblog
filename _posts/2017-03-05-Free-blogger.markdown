It was back in 2012, when I made my first blog, That was a blog hosted in [wordpress(dot)com](http://wordpress.com), then about a year later, in 2013, I deleted that blog and made another one in [blogspot](http://blogspot.com), then nex year I went to live in a hostel where using internet was not allowed. Then when I got back, I again deleted my blog. Then when I completed my school level, I had no work to do, until my highschool starts, which had a gap of three months. Then I started to discover internet, then I found about a website [dot(dot)tk](dot.tk) which gave free dot tk domains. Then in 2014 I made my blog [bibekadhikari.tk](/). Which I used to maintain by blogger. Between these periods, I had already learnt `HTML` and `CSS`, then being unable to use what I had learnt on blogger, I deleted that blog again. Then I searched for free web hosting sites. I hosted throuh many sites, the first was [1freehosting](http://1freehosting.com), then I went through [000webhost](http://000webhost.com), then others, there I made a blog using only html and css, then as soon as my blog started to get some visitiors, even 100 a day, that made my blog crash atleast trice for every 10 times. Then I installed [wordpress](http://wordpress.com) in my website, that made the website lag even more, it was next to impossible to read two pages consecutively without being told server has crashed once. Then I had a visti of one hosting to other, exploring one after another. Every free hosting provider had atleast one problem. Either it be speed, bandwidth, space, or anything. Something always made a problem. Then back in 2016 being frustrated, I again deleted my blog. I was in a problem regarding my blog. I have deleted my blog more than 10 times. Deleted almost 100 posts and for nothing. Then I heard about jekyll, I really wanted to write blog again, make designs again, I explored [github](http://github.com), read posts, written posts, made designs and reopened my blog. And what have i spend 0$. For my blog, I've never spent even a cent. If I do not count the internet pack, that I was using for writing my blog, I am not counting it because even if I had a paid hosting, I had to spent additional money for writing posts using my internet packs. If you also want to make a blog, just for writing, spent no money, as you can do it all for free. But if you have a mentality of earning money by writing blog. Then I recommend you to get a commercial domain, spend a few bucks to get your domain and hosting, perhaps you get free domain with your paid hosting. But if you possibly want a free domain, then you can go to [freenom](http://freenom.com)

Now you can register like you do for any social network and you new free domain is up and running.
